# Evalu8

In this thesis project we examine pre-existing performance evaluation tools and identify their shortcomings for usage in computer science classrooms in a university setting. We then present a newly developed software application called **Evalu8**, meant to be used as a performance evaluation tool for student managers. We identify three main metrics that are at the heart of performance evaluation in the software engineering industry and convert them to metrics which can be used in a computer science curriculum for university. 

We adopt these newly established metrics in the performance evaluation tool Evalu8 and configure a method for student managers to evaluate their team members who collaborate on software engineering projects in courses which use GitHub repositories for codebase storage. The main metrics used for team member evaluation provided in Evalu8 are team member engagement, contribution, and progress. These metrics are used to establish clear criteria for student managers in courses such as COMPSCI 529: Software Engineering Project Management at the University of Massachusetts â€“ Amherst, to evaluate and grade their team members without any ambiguity. To establish validity of the application and its performance capabilities, Evalu8 has been usability tested using learnability, memorability, efficiency, and satisfaction scores as defined by Nielsen's definition of usability. Evalu8 opens up new opportunities for performance evaluation tool usage by students in a university setting.

Evalu8 has been programmed with a ReactJS frontend, a NodeJS backend and a relational PostgreSQL database.
